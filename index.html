    <h2>Doggie Daycare Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Safety is our number one priority. In order to ensure their safety and the
      safety of our other guests, each dog is given a two-part evaluation before
      being permitted to join group play sessions. Pets who prefer to spend time
      alone will receive customized, individual play sessions so they can still
      get the most out of their stay!
    </p>
    <p>Our large open areas feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spacious indoor and outdoor yards</li>
      <li>
        Multiple play structures and yards for all sized dogs with enough room
        to zoom for all energy levels
      </li>
      <li>Raised beds throughout for those that need a break from playing</li>
      <li>Ample water bowls and overhangs to provide shade</li>
      <li>Pool parties in our in-ground, bone-shaped swimming pools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      *Your pet must be spayed or neutered to participate in All Day Play. For
      pets who are not spayed or neutered, our Day board option will be
      available. Please contact the resort for additional information.
