      <p class="daycare">
        Safety is our number one priority. In order to ensure their safety and
        the safety of our other guests, each dog is given a two-part evaluation
        before being permitted to join group play sessions. Pets who prefer to
        spend time alone will receive customized, individual play sessions so
        they can still get the most out of their stay!
